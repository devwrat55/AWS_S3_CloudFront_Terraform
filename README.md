# AWS_S3_CloudFront_Terraform
Do check the comment section for the complete video link  I performed a small practical where I deployed a simple website on AWS. I used AWS services efficiently by using S3 bucket with CloudFront CDN infrastructure, which reduced latency to access the website over the globe. I successfully built this complete infrastructure using Terraform, I did not do any manual configurations, or can say that, did not use AWS User Interface (aws website)  Note: You can visit the hosted website till today(21 June, 2020) 12 noon.

Also thank you Durgesh Pachghare for such beautiful website
